# argos-extensions

Just a compilation of some GNOME Shell extensions which add collapsible indicators in the Gnome top bar
that I have made for my personal machine and that might be useful to adapt for someone else.

These have been built using the nice API provided by [p-e-w's Argos](https://github.com/p-e-w/argos)
project, which provides an easy-to-use API (via Python or Bash scripts) to avoid the need for
direct interaction with the ever-changing JavaScript API of GNOME.
